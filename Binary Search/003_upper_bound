You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers and an integer ‘x’.
Implement the ‘upper bound’ function to find the index of the upper bound of 'x' in the array.

Example:
Input : ‘arr’ = {2,4,6,7} and ‘x’ = 5,
Output: 2
Explanation: The upper bound of 5 is 6 in the given array, which is at index 2 (0-indexed).

#Java soln-

public class Solution {
    public static int upperBound(int []arr, int x, int n){
        int low=0,high=n-1,ans=n;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            if(arr[mid]>x){
                ans=mid;
                high=mid-1;
            }
            else low=mid+1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
