Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.

Examples :
Input: n = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.
Input: n = 15
Output: 31
Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 01111. After setting right most bit it becomes 11111 which is 31.

# java soln 1

class Solution {
    static int setBit(int n) {
       return n|n+1;
    }}

# java soln 2

class Solution {
    static int setBit(int n) {
        int x=0;
        int y=1;
        while(x<=n){
            x=n | y;
            y=y<<1;
        }
        return x;
    }}
