Given an integer n representing number of vertices. Find out how many undirected graphs
(not necessarily connected) can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices.

Example:
Input: 2
Output: 2

#Java Soln

class Solution {
    static long count(int n) {
    int Edges= n*(n-1)/2;
    return (long)Math.pow(2, Edges);
}
  }
