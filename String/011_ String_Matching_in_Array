Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that is a substring of another word.
You can return the answer in any order.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

Example 1:
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero". ["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.

            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if (j!=i && (words[j].contains(words[i]))) {
                    ans.add(words[i]);
